# Learning_JS
This is a collection of notes on how to code using java script language using two videos by Osama Elzero course on youtube.

## Course notes:
1. Where to put the js code in your html?
You can put your code in 2 Places, either before the head closes or right before the body tag closes. But what is the actual difference here?
Well, your code interpter goes line by line. So it is better for you to add the script tag right before the body tag. Because when you put it in the head, your called element in the body below hasn't shown up yet. This will give you a Typeerror in your console log.
2. JS use WEB API to process the language like translating what the console wants.
3. ECMAScript: ECMA is a company that decides the standards for programming lanugages, especialy for scriptting languages. Babel makes you use the old formats of JS and you can use it to interpret your code.


#### How to color in your console method?
Add %c before the word you want to style, then add the styling in same squares but different "".
